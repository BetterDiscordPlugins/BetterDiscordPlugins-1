Plugins I've written for BetterDiscord

## BDEmotesFFZPrioritizer
Fixes BD's third-party emotes so that FFZ emotes have priority over BTTV ones, since the BTTV versions are often broken or just plain inferior.

## DefaultChannels
Allows you to force discord to switch to a specific channel the first time (or every time) you switch to a particular server after launching discord. Good for e.g. checking announcement channels before moving elsewhere.

## InlineJsEval
Allows you to execute JavaScript directly from within the textbox by typing e.g. `eval(1 + 1)` and pressing tab after the closing parenthesis. Drive responsibly.

## Texty
Let's you make loud, obnoxious emoji block text using markup e:like this:

## WhoAreYou
Displays a user's actual username next to their nickname in chat messages. Handy for keeping track of users who change their nicks a lot.

## Zalgo
Creates zalgo text l̕i̸̶͜ḱ͟e͏̶͢ ̨̛t̢̛҉̧ḩ͘i͘̕͏́͟ş̸̢͘͏ (see http://eeemo.net/) by typing e.g. `{{some text here}}` and pressing tab or enter. Discord helps keep the corruption from extending beyond the line containing it, so no worries about obscuring unrelated text.
